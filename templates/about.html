  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>
    I'm <strong>Yashwanth Reddy</strong>, a Software Engineer with 3 years of experience in full-stack development, backend architecture, and AI system integration. I specialize in Python, Flask, Node.js, and Azure, with a strong interest in cloud-based deployments and intelligent application design.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at the University of Bridgeport, I combine academic learning with hands-on engineering experience to build scalable, real-world software systems.

  <h2>Vision</h2>
  <p>
    I’m passionate about building production-grade systems that bring AI, data, and cloud technologies together. My goal is to engineer solutions that are scalable, intelligent, and resilient — systems that work as well in theory as they do in the field.
